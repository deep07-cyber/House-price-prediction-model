# 🏡 House Price Prediction Model

This project builds a predictive model for estimating house prices using Machine Learning, specifically Linear Regression. It covers the complete workflow—from data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis (EDA) to feature engineering, model training, visualization, and performance evaluation.

## 📌 Features
- Clean & messy dataset handling  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Data visualizations   
- Outlier detection and removal  
- Model training using Linear Regression  
- Model evaluation (MAE, RMSE, R² Score)  
- Prediction on new data

## 🎨 Visualization Tools Used
This project uses the following visualization libraries:

- **Matplotlib** → basic plots (line chart, scatter plot, bar chart)  
- **Seaborn** → heatmaps, pairplots, correlation maps, boxplots, distplots  
- **Pandas Plotting** → quick line/scatter plots from dataframe  
  
Example visualizations include:
- Distribution of house prices  
- Correlation heatmap  
- Scatter plot: Area vs Price  
- Boxplot to detect outliers
